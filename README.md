# Jenkins-test
• Clone the Git repository and copy the code into the subversion working copy
in a subdirectory git-code.
• Build (you can just assume make install does it all for example)
• Test (you can assume make test executes all tests)
• If building and testing succeed, push the changes to Git
• Send an email to report on success or failure
• Clean up your temporary files.
